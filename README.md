comicBookapp-ang
================
updated - 11/02/2013
working on this again after gaining more knowledge on angular
and git

personal learning project using angular, bootstrap, flot and more experimentations tbd
The goal is to write an app to track comic book collection.
currently it can be run to see what's been done and where it might be heading.

setup instructions:
the vendors folder has been excluded as they are mostly plugins and shouldn't be included here
so you'll need to get these and place them in the vendors folder

as of 11/2013
bootstrap.js
jquery.flot.categories.js
jquery.flot.js
jquery-1.10.2.js
ng-grid-2.0.5.min.js
ng-grid-layout.js
ui-bootstrap-0.3.0.js
underscore.js

thanks.
